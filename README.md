# Python QT and Python PyGObject
## What is PyQt, PySide2?
Qt for Python offers the official Python bindings for Qt (PySide2), so that you can use Qt5 APIs in your Python applications, and a binding generator tool (Shiboken2) which can be used to expose C++ projects into Python.
Qt for Python is available under the LGPLv3/GPLv3 and the Qt commercial license.

PyQt is one of the most popular Python bindings for the Qt cross-platform C++ framework. PyQt developed by Riverbank Computing Limited. Qt itself is developed as part of the Qt Project. PyQt provides bindings for Qt 4 and Qt 5. PyQt is distributed under a choice of licences: GPL version 3 or a commercial license.
### Qt Designer
Qt Designer is the Qt tool for designing and building graphical user interfaces (GUIs) with Qt Widgets. You can compose and customize your windows or dialogs in a what-you-see-is-what-you-get (WYSIWYG) manner, and test them using different styles and resolutions.

## What is PyGTK and PyGObject?
Linux desktop using the GTK+ library with Python programming language which is called “PyGObject”. PyGObject uses the GObject Introspection to create binding for programming languages like Python, PyGObject is the next generation from PyGTK, you can say that PyGObject = Python + GTK3.

PyGTK is a set of Python wrappers for the GTK+ graphical user interface library. PyGTK is free software and licensed under the LGPL. It is analogous to PyQt/PySide and wxPython, the Python wrappers for Qt and wxWidgets, respectively. Its original author is GNOME developer James Henstridge.

PyGObject provides a wrapper for use in Python programs when accessing GObject libraries. GObject is an object system used by GTK+, GLib, GObject, GIO, GStreamer and other libraries. Like the GObject library itself, PyGObject is licensed under the GNU LGPL, so it is suitable for use in both free software and proprietary applications. It is already in use in many applications ranging from small single-purpose scripts to large full-featured applications.

PyGObject can dynamically accesses any GObject libraries that use GObject Introspection. It replaces the need for separate modules such as PyGTK, GIO and python-gnome to build a full GNOME 3.0 application. Once new functionality is added to GObject library it is instantly available as a Python API without the need for intermediate Python glue.

### What is Glade?
Glade is a RAD tool to enable quick & easy development of user interfaces for the GTK+ toolkit and the GNOME desktop environment.
The user interfaces designed in Glade are saved as XML, and by using the GtkBuilder GTK+ object these can be loaded by applications dynamically as needed.

Glade is Free Software released under the GNU GPL License
